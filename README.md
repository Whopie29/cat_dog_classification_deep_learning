# Cat vs Dog Prediction using Transfer Learning and Feature Extraction

## 📂 Project Overview
This project classifies images of cats and dogs using a deep learning model with transfer learning and feature extraction techniques. By leveraging a pre-trained model, we efficiently train the network to distinguish between cat and dog images with high accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of cat and dog images. You can obtain a similar dataset from resources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## 🚀 Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** A pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet)
- **Feature Extraction:** Freeze initial layers, train only the top layers
- **Output Layer:** Binary classification (Cat vs Dog)

## 🏗️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-vs-dog-prediction.git
   cd cat-vs-dog-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃 Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook transfer_learning_feature_extraction_(cat-vs-dog)_prediction.ipynb
```
Follow the notebook cells to train the model and visualize results.

## 🖼️ Results
The model achieves competitive accuracy, and sample predictions are visualized with Matplotlib.
